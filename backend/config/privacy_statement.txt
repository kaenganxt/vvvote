Privacy Statement
In case of using a single sign on server (SSO), Vvvote contacts that to check the eligibility. 
Vvvote stores an identifier obtained from the SSO server in order to make sure that no voter
are given more than one voting certificate.
Voting using the voring certificate is anonymouse - the certificate is encrypted before the Vvvote
servers sign it, so that the Vvvote servers cannot do a match from the vote to the voter.
In order to make sure that an evil admin cannot do that, the vote is sent encrypted through 
an anonymising service which changes the sender IP and removes the browser's fingerprint.
